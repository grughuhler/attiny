This directory contains a program that demonstrates pin interrupts
on an ATtiny under Arduino, tested on an ATtiny 3224.  It

* Enables interrupts on two external pins.
* Toggles output pins when the interrupts are serviced.
* Counts interrupts over a 1 second interval.
* Displays the counts once per second on an i2c OLED display.

It is documented in a YouTube video.
