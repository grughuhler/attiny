This directory contains an Arduino sketch that implements an i2c slave
on an attiny 1614 microcontroller.  It should work on any series 1 or
2 attiny.

I tested this on a board that I built.  This board contains 20 LEDs
(two 10-LED bars) that are controlled using charlieplexing with 5
attiny signals.

See https://youtu.be/Y6cBaTSOIQY for my video on charlieplexing.

The i2c slave function is decribed in a different video:

There is i2c master software in directory control_leds.  You can use a
Linux PC with a CP2112 USB to i2c adapter as a master.  Also, a
Raspberry Pi should work with its native i2c pins.
