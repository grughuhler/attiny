This directory contains i2c master software to drive an attiny i2c
slave board that charlieplexes 20 LEDs.  Function do_write writes a
value to the slave to be displayed on the LEDs.
                                                                              
This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS using a CP2112 USB to i2c
adapter.  It should also work on a Raspberry Pi using the Pi's native
i2c pins.  Install these packages:
                                                                              
   sudo apt install i2c-tools libi2c-dev                                      
                                                                              
If running the attiny at 5V, you will need signal level converters
since the CP2112 or Raspberry Pi are using 3.3V signaling.

You may have to adjust I2C_BUS in the source file.  For a Raspberry Pi,
it is probably "/dev/i2c-1".  For a Linux PC, watch and see what appears
when you plug in the CP2112 board.
