# ATtiny Adapter Board
This directory contains two gerber file sets for SOIC-14 to DIP adapter
boards suitable for 14-pin attiny microcontrollers.  Either can be used
to order boards from companies such as pcbway.com.

The first one (built_adap0.zip) was built and documented in YouTube
video [ATtiny adapter](https://youtu.be/i0RURwuS72Q).

The second (more_silk_adap0_gerber.zip) is the same but adds some
additional silk screen text.  It has not been built or tested but
probably is OK.

This is a rendering of more_silk_adap0_gerber.zip.  The other is
similar but omits most of the silk screen text.
