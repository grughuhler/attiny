This program shows how the attiny event system can tie together other
attiny hardware blocks and let them run independently from the core,
even when the core is asleep (in standby mode).

It implements a nightlight with a switch that overrides the darkness
sensor (a phototransistor) and turns on the nightlight LED.

It has been tested on both an attiny series 1 part (the 412) and on a
series 2 part (the 3224).

It demonstrates: The attiny event system working with

  - the configurable custom logic (CCL) block
  - the analog comparator (AC).
  - input pins
  - the port A EVOUT pin

And it demonstrates attiny power management, in particular sleeping in
the standby mode state with wake up from an interrupt from the
Periodic Interval Timer (PIT).

It is explained in YouTube video:
