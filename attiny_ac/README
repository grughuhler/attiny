This program demonstrates the ATtiny analog comparator on a series 1
attiny, the 1614.  It measures the frequency at which a light source
blinks using a photo transistor as a sensor.

The ATtiny 1614 is unusual in that it has 3 ACs, but the program only
uses one of them.

It is documented by a YouTube video:
