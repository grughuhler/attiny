This program demonstrates driect interrupts on an ATtiny 412
microcontroller. Direct interrupts are specific to megatinycore and do
not use the standard Arduino API attachInterrupt.  This increases
interrupt performance.

The program implements two interrupts.

1.  An external pin interrupt (IRQ) that is used to measure maximum
    interrupts per second.
2.  A periodic interrupt from the RTC/PIT peripheral.  This is used to
    implement the switch debounce algorithm that Jack Ganssle described.

This was tested using megatinycore on Arduino 1.8.19.
